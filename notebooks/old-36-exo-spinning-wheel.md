# practice : a spinning wheel

```{code-cell}
delete require.cache[require.resolve('../js/toolsv3')]
tools = require('../js/toolsv3')
tools.init()
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## Objective

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true

tools.sample_from_stem("../samples/spinning-wheel", {sources_show: false})
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## How to code: General TIPS

* First do not think on coding but think about what do you want to achieve
* Decopose the think you try to achive in smaller think, for exemple, for the spinning wheel above:
  * you need a button
  * you need circles
  * you need to change the color of circle
  * you need to start/stop by pressing the button
  * and more ...
* Try to achive the smallest objectives first separatly or independently
  * At this step the search engine can help :)
  * **BUT NEVER USE THING THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND**
  * **Always** try to understand what you are using from others
  * **Always** adapt the code you want use from others
* Gather all technics aquire in previous step and combinne them
* Merge all thing together
* Enjoy

## Tips

**Do not loook at notebook code if you want learn something but use your favorite search engine**

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #1

Make the base layout with dummy button and svg area

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #2

Draw circles on the base layout using java script (inline script is ok)

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #3

Change color and style of painted circle

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #4

Animate the color to make transition

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #5

Fix the animation to give the desired look

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #6

Make the animation stopable

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #7

make the animation startabel/stopable by pressing the button

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": "slide"}}

## Step #8

Cleanup the code, and cleanup again

## a few hints

+++

For example (but that's entirely up to you)

* write a JavaScript class `SpinningWheel` 
* that can be created from :
  * a `svg` element
  * the circle's center and radius `cx`, `cy`, `cr`,
  * the number of dots, the radius of dots `n_dots`, `r_dots`
  * the period in milliseconds (for one wheel round)
  * two colours for the 'dark' and 'light' ends of the spectrum
* and with methods like
  * `start()`
  * `stop()`
  * `resume()`
  * `clear()` 
  
* it may be helpful to create a convenience function that creates an SVG element inside a container that is found through its id;  
  e.g. `create_spinning_wheel("spin-container")` would create (and return) a `SpinningWheel` instance inside (the element found by selector) `#spin-container`

+++

* attach to the `load` event of your page
* a function that creates the spinning wheel
  and then and stops it after a fixed duration

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## remember also that

+++

* svg elements need to be created with the right namespace, i.e.:

```javascript
const svgNS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
let dot = document.createElementNS(svgNS, 'circle');
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## the  HTML part

+++

your html part could look like the following  

```{code-cell}
:hide_input: true

fs = require('fs');
html = fs.readFileSync("../samples/spinning-wheel.html", "utf-8");
[start, end ] = [html.indexOf("<body>"), html.indexOf("</body>")];
extract = html.slice(start, end+7);
$$.html(`<code><pre>${tools.escape(extract)}</pre></code>`);
```

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## observe

* the HTML document is mostly empty, and gets populated by program

* as usual now, the way we attach a callback to the `load` event  

+++ {"slideshow": {"slide_type": ""}}

## observe (2)

* how tedious it is to have to pass all arguments to the class constructor - because JavaScript does not support (yet?) default values parameters  
  in similar situations, a common practice is to impose only a small set of required parameters, and then to accept a single `options` argument
  
So one could offer instead:

```javascript
SpinningWheel(radius, options) {
   ...
}
```

and allow callers to set specific parameters in the `options` object; for examples one could call

```javascript
let spin = SpinningWheel(100, 
                         { bg_color: [200, 100, 50], period=500})
```
and have the `SpinningClass` code provide default for missing parameters.

+++

### optional assignments

+++

students who have finished the exercise can :

* tweak their code to adapt to this more convenient interface
* make the wheel vanish automatically after the timeout
* add some interactive means to
  * clear the wheel
  * create new wheels upon mouse clicks
* etc…
