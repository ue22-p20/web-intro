start from this tutorial here
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-an-html-calculator-app-from-scratch-using-javascript-4454b8714b98/

it comes [**with the html and css template**](https://codepen.io/zellwk/pen/pLgmGL) for a - rather nice btw - yet simple, calculator

the assignment is to write the **javascript companion** so that

* the device **actually does calculations**
* in a first step, ignore the '.' and just write an integer calculator

```{code-cell}

## How to code: General TIPS

* First do not think on coding but think about what do you want to achieve
* Decopose the think you try to achive in smaller think, for exemple, for the spinning wheel above:
  * you need a button
  * you need circles
  * you need to change the color of circle
  * you need to start/stop by pressing the button
  * and more ...
* Try to achive the smallest objectives first separatly or independently
  * At this step the search engine can help :)
  * **BUT NEVER USE THING THAT YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND**
  * **Always** try to understand what you are using from others
  * **Always** adapt the code you want use from others
* Gather all technics aquire in previous step and combinne them
* Merge all thing together
* Enjoy
